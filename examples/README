Welcome to v6rcfiles-20081109!

V6rcfiles is a collection of rc files for osh(1).  The entire
collection may be studied as is.  The rc files may also be used
as templates, modified, and installed for personal or general use.

-------
INSTALL:
1) If needed, it is recommended to modify the etc.* and dot.* files
   to taste before installation.  However, please try not to modify
   any of the @EXECSHELL@, @SOURCE_OSHDIR@, or @SYSCONFDIR@ strings.
   The INSTALL script automatically translates these strings into
   appropriate values during installation.

2) Run the INSTALL script to install all of the rc files.

	usage: ./INSTALL [user]

If possible, it installs all the system-wide rc files (etc.*) into
the SYSCONFDIR directory specified at osh compile time and found
in the first osh binary on the current PATH ($p).  If possible, it
installs all user rc files (dot.*) into the current HOME ($h)
directory.

All installed user rc files shall be owned by `user' if specified.
No existent system-wide or user rc files shall be overwritten.

If all rc files install successfully, it exits w/ zero status (true).
Otherwise, it prints diagnostic(s) and exits w/ non-zero status (false).

...
Depending on your system configuration, you may need to become the
superuser in order to successfully install the system-wide rc files.
In such a case, using su(1) or sudo(8) may be valid options depending
on your system.

If you have any comments or questions about this software, I encourage
you to contact me via email.  Thanks & Enjoy!
