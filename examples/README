From OSH(1):

   Initialization (+)
       If the first character of the  name  used  to  invoke  the
       shell  is  `-'  (e.g.,  -osh), it is assumed to be a login
       shell and shall attempt to read the following three  files
       in sequence: /etc/osh.login, $h/.osh.login, and $h/.oshrc.
       For each of these files which exists and is readable,  the
       shell executes the commands contain within.

       In  the  case  where  an  interactive shell is not a login
       shell, it shall only try  to  execute  commands  from  one
       file:  $h/.oshrc.   In  any case, after the shell finishes
       with the appropriate initialization file(s) it shall  then
       prompt the user for input as usual.

       In the normal case, a SIGINT or SIGQUIT signal received by
       the shell during  execution  of  any  initialization  file
       causes  it  to cease execution of that file, but this does
       not terminate the shell.  Note that in some cases  it  may
       be  desirable  to use the trap special command in order to
       ignore these, and possibly other signals as well.

       Any signal which is not being ignored, or an exit command,
       in  any  of  the  initialization files causes the shell to
       terminate immediately.

       Note that all initialization files intended to be used  by
       the shell must be of a regular type.  That is, they cannot
       be directories, FIFOs, or any other type of file.  If  the
       file  is  not a regular file, the shell simply ignores it,
       prints a diagnostic, and tries the next file  (if any)  or
       prompts the user for input as it normally does.
