Welcome to Etsh (V6Shell) RC Files!

The Sixth Edition (V6) Thompson shell did not read/execute rc
(init & logout) files.  The fact that etsh does so is simply one
of its enhancements.  This makes etsh a much better login shell
than it might be otherwise, as the ability to execute rc files
can make things much easier for the user.  An rc file is simply a
regular shell script, aka command file, that the shell handles in
a special way.

For full details about how etsh handles rc files, please refer to
the "Startup and shutdown" subsection of etsh(1) manual page @
https://etsh.io/man/_etsh.1.html#Startup_and_shutdown_(+) or
https://etsh.io/man/etsh.1.html#StartupAndShutdown .

This collection of etsh(1) rc files may be studied as is, used as
templates, modified, and/or installed for personal or general use.

-------
INSTALL:

1) The etsh* files are system-wide rc files for SYSCONFDIR, defaults
   to $(PREFIX)/etc.

2) The .etsh* files are user rc files for user HOME ($h) directories,
   and also for /etc/skel depending on sysadmin desires / needs.

3) You can install them into the EXPDIR directory, defaults to
   $(PREFIX)/share/examples/etsh, with the install-exp target.
   See the ../INSTALL file for full details.

4) Along the way, modify the etsh* and .etsh* files to taste.

5) Then, copy them to SYSCONFDIR, HOME, and/or /etc/skel
   (changing user / group / mode as needed).

...
Not to state the obvious, but..  Depending on system configuration,
you may need to become the superuser in order to successfully install
system-wide rc files! ;^)

-------
I install and use variations of these files on several different
systems.  This includes OpenBSD, NetBSD, (Mac) OS X, and GNU/Linux.
On GNU/Linux systems, you should refer to the manual pages for the
utilities invoked in these files as there may be incompatibilities
that I have not encountered.  For example, this is true for stty(1).

If you have any comments or questions about this software, I encourage
you to contact me via email.  Thanks & Enjoy!
