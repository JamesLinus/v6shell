Welcome to Osh (V6Shell) RC Files!

The Sixth Edition Thompson shell did not read/execute rc (init and
logout) files.  The fact that osh does so is simply one of its
enhancements.  This makes osh a much better login shell than it
might be otherwise, as the ability to execute rc files can make
things much easier for the user.  An rc file is simply a regular
shell script, aka command file, that the shell treats specially.

For full details about how osh handles rc files, please refer to
the "Startup and shutdown" subsection of osh(1) manual page @
http://v6shell.org/man/osh.1.html#StartupAndShutdown .

This collection of osh(1) rc files may be studied as is, used as
templates, modified, and/or installed for personal or general use.

-------
INSTALL:
1) Run FILEPREP script to prepare rc files for installation.

	usage: osh FILEPREP /path/to/nonexistent_directory

2) cd or chdir to specified directory.

3) Modify *osh* files to taste (e.g., change PATH, etc).

4) Copy *osh* files to destinations noted in fileprep.log .

...
Depending on system configuration, you may need to become superuser
in order to successfully install system-wide rc files.

-------
I install and use variations of these files on several different
systems.  This includes GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and
OpenSolaris.  On GNU/Linux systems, you may wish to refer to the
manual pages for the utilities invoked in these files as there might
be incompatibilities that I have not encountered.  For example,
this is true for stty(1).

If you have any comments or questions about this software, I encourage
you to contact me via email.  Thanks & Enjoy!
