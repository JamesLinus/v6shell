Initialization files:

	1) etc.osh.login
		This is a system-wide initialization file for login shells.
		It can be installed as `/etc/osh.login' after modification.

	2) dot.osh.login
		This is a user initialization file for login shells.
		It can be installed as `$h/.osh.login' after modification.

	3) dot.oshrc
		This is a user initialization file for interactive shells.
		It can be installed as `$h/.oshrc' after modification.

These three example initialization files have been written to work
together.  For further info, see the osh(1) manual page.

Command files:

	1) counts
		This sh6 command file demonstrates loop control
		using `shift'.

	2) pusage
		This sh6 command file prints a usage message for a
		command file and exits w/ a non-zero status.

	3) strlen
		This osh command file prints the length of a
		specified string.

	4) which
		This sh6 command file locates program file(s) in
		the user's command search PATH.

	5) xtitle
		This osh command file sets the window title for
		terminal emulators under X.

Notice that all of the sh6 command files listed above can be run
w/ osh instead if the user wishes to do so.  The following command
line will suffice to modify the file given by `name' so that it
uses osh rather than sh6 (replace `name' as appropriate):

	% <name ( rm -f name; sed 's/sh6/osh/g' >name ); chmod 0555 name

If desired, repeat the command line as appropriate for each of the
sh6 command files needing modification.  Notice that a variety of
command files are also available at the following URL:
