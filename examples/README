Welcome to Osh (V6Shell) RC Files!

The Sixth Edition Thompson shell did not read/execute rc (init and
logout) files.  The fact that osh does so is simply one of its
enhancements.  This makes osh a much better login shell than it
might be otherwise, as the ability to execute rc files can make
things much easier for the user.  An rc file is simply a regular
shell script, aka command file, that the shell treats specially.

For full details about how osh handles rc files, please refer to
the "Startup and shutdown" subsection of osh(1) manual page @
https://v6shell.org/man/osh.1.html#StartupAndShutdown .

This collection of osh(1) rc files may be studied as is, used as
templates, modified, and/or installed for personal or general use.

-------
INSTALL:

1) The etc.* files are system-wide rc files, assuming SYSCONFDIR=/etc,
   the default for shells/osh in OpenBSD Ports.

2) The dot.* files are user rc files for user HOME ($h) directories,
   and also for /etc/skel depending on sysadmin desires / needs.

3) So, modify the etc.* and dot.* files to taste.

4) Then, copy them to the destinations noted above
   (changing user / group / mode as needed).

...
Not to state the obvious, but..  Depending on system configuration,
you may need to become the superuser in order to successfully install
system-wide rc files! ;^)

-------
I install and use variations of these files on several different
systems.  This includes OpenBSD, NetBSD, (Mac) OS X, and GNU/Linux.
On GNU/Linux systems, you should refer to the manual pages for the
utilities invoked in these files as there may be incompatibilities
that I have not encountered.  For example, this is true for stty(1).

If you have any comments or questions about this software, I encourage
you to contact me via email.  Thanks & Enjoy!
