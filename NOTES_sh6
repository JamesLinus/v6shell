Historical notes:

The Thompson shell, by Ken Thompson of Bell Labs, was distributed
as the standard command interpreter through Sixth Edition Unix.
Then, in the Seventh Edition, it was replaced by the Bourne shell.
However, the Thompson shell was still distributed with the system
as osh because of known portability problems with the Bourne shell's
memory management in Seventh Edition Unix.

The Thompson shell from Sixth Edition Unix used the following
external utilities:

	1) /bin/exit was used to terminate command files.

	2) /bin/goto was used to transfer the shell's control
	   from one point to another within a command file.

	3) /bin/if was used to evaluate conditional expressions.
	   This is the predecessor of test(1), which was first
	   released in Seventh Edition Unix.

	4) /etc/glob was used to expand `*', `?', and `[...]'
	   in command arguments.

The functionality of each of the above-mentioned utilities is
provided here.  However, the `exit' utility is implemented as a
special built-in command.  The `glob' utility has been renamed to
`glob6' and is installed into the same directory as the shell,
rather than being installed into the /etc directory.

Refer to the goto(1) and if(1) manual pages for further details
on those utilities.

Compatibility notes:

This is a port of the Thompson shell from Sixth Edition Unix.
However, when it is known to differ in some way from the original,
this fact is indicated in the sh6(1) manual page.

Aside from those differences which are detailed in the manual page,
the CHANGES_sh-to-sh6 file contains further information about how
this port differs from the original.
