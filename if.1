.SH NAME
if \- conditional command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B if
\fIexpr\fR [\fIcommand\fR [\fIarg ...\fR]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I If
evaluates the expression
.IR expr ,
and if its value is true,
returns a zero exit status or executes the specified
.I command
with the given arguments;
otherwise, a non-zero exit status is returned.
.PP
The following primaries are used to construct
.IR expr :
.TP 10n
.BI \-d " file"
True if \fIfile\fR exists and is a directory.
.TP
.BI \-e " file"
True if \fIfile\fR exists.
.TP
.BI \-f " file"
True if \fIfile\fR exists and is a regular file.
.TP
.BI \-r " file"
True if \fIfile\fR exists and is readable.
.TP
.BI \-w " file"
True if \fIfile\fR exists and is writable.
.TP
.IB s1 " = " s2
True if the strings
.I s1
and
.I s2
are equal.
.TP
.IB s1 " != " s2
True if the strings
.I s1
and
.I s2
are not equal.
.TP
.BI "{ " "command" " }"
The bracketed command is executed to obtain the exit status.
Status zero is considered \fItrue\fP.
.PP
These primaries may be combined with the following operators:
.TP
.B !
unary negation operator
.TP
.B \-a
binary
.I and
operator
.TP
.B \-o
binary
.I or
operator
.TP
.BI "( " "expr" " )"
parentheses for grouping.
.PP
.B \-a
has higher precedence than
.BR \-o .
Notice that all the operators and flags are separate arguments to
.I if
and hence must be surrounded by spaces.
Notice also that parentheses are meaningful
to the shell and must be escaped.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
Is the sequence of directories used to search for command.
The
.I if
command from Sixth Edition
.SM UNIX
always used `.:/bin:/usr/bin', not
.SM PATH.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
goto(1),
osh(1)
.SH COMPATIBILITY
The
.I if
command from Sixth Edition
.SM UNIX
does not support the
.BR \-d ,
.BR \-e ,
or
.B \-f
operators.
