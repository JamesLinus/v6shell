Historical notes:

The Thompson shell, by Ken Thompson of Bell Labs, was used as the
standard command interpreter through Sixth Edition Unix.  In the
Seventh Edition, it was replaced by the Bourne shell and then made
available as osh.

The Thompson shell from Sixth Edition Unix used the following
external utilities:

	1) /bin/exit was used to terminate command files.

	2) /bin/goto was used to transfer the shell's control
	   from one point to another within a command file.

	3) /bin/if was used to evaluate conditional expressions.
	   This is the predecessor of test(1), which was first
	   released in Seventh Edition Unix.

	4) /etc/glob was used to expand `*', `?', and `[...]'
	   in command arguments.

The functionality of each of the above-mentioned utilities is
provided here.  However, the `exit' utility is implemented as a
special built-in command, and `glob' is built into the shell by
using glob(3) from the C library.

Refer to the manual pages for if(1) and goto(1) for further details
on those utilities.
