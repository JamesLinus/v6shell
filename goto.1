.SH NAME
goto \- transfer command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI goto \ label
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Goto
is allowed only when the shell is taking commands
from a seekable file (see
.IR lseek (2)).
.PP
The entire file is searched for a line beginning
with a `\fB:\fR' followed by one or more spaces followed by the
.IR label .
If such a line is found, the
.I goto
command repositions the read pointer in the file to the line
after the label and returns.
This effectively causes the shell to transfer control
to the labelled line.
.PP
`\fB:\fR' is a do-nothing
command which is ignored by the shell.
