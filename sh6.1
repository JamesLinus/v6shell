.TH SH6 1 "October 28, 2004" "osh-041028" "General Commands"
.SH NAME
sh6 \- shell (command interpreter)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sh6
[[\fB\-\fR | \fB\-c\fR [\fIstring\fR] | \fB\-t\fR | \fIfile\fR]
[\fIarg1 ...\fR]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sh6
is a backward-compatible reimplementation of the
standard command interpreter from Sixth Edition
.SM UNIX.
It is usable both as an interactive and non-interactive shell.
Throughout this manual, `(+)' marks where
.I sh6
is known to differ from the Sixth Edition
.SM UNIX
shell.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.B \-
Suppress prompting;
the shell reads and executes command lines from its standard input
until terminated by end-of-file (or possibly by
.BR exit ).
.TP
\fB\-c\fR [\fIstring\fR]
The shell executes
.I string
as a command line and exits.
If no string is specified,
the shell behaves in the same way as for the \fB\-\fR option.
.TP
.B \-t
The shell reads a single line from the standard input,
executes it as a command line,
and then exits.
.PP
If no arguments are specified and if both the standard input
and standard error are connected to a terminal,
the shell is interactive.
An interactive shell prompts the user
with a `%\ ' (or `#\ ' for the superuser)
before reading each command line from the terminal.
.PP
The shell can also be invoked as a non-interactive command
to interpret command files (shell scripts).
.SS Commands
Each command is a sequence of non-blank command arguments
separated by blanks (spaces or tabs).
The first argument specifies the name of a command to be executed.
Except for certain types of special arguments described below,
the arguments other than the command name are passed
without interpretation to the invoked command.
.PP
If the first argument names a special command,
it is executed (see
.I "Special commands"
below).
Otherwise, the shell treats it as an external command which is
located as follows.
If the command name contains a `/' character,
it is executed without performing any searches.
(+) Otherwise,
the sequence of directories in the environment variable
.SM PATH
is searched for the first occurrence
of an executable file by the same name
which the shell attempts to execute.
.PP
If the command cannot be found,
or cannot be executed,
a diagnostic is printed.
.SS Command lines
Commands separated by `|' or `^' constitute a chain of
.IR filters ,
or a
.IR pipeline .
The standard output of each command but the last
is taken as the standard input of the next command.
Each command is run as a separate process, connected
by pipes (see
.IR pipe (2))
to its neighbors.
A command line contained in parentheses `(\ )' is executed in a
subshell and may appear in place of a simple command as a filter.
.PP
A
.I "command line"
consists of one or more pipelines separated,
and perhaps terminated by `;' or `&'.
The semicolon designates sequential execution.
The ampersand designates asynchronous execution which causes
the preceding pipeline to be executed without waiting for it
to finish.
The process ID of such a pipeline is reported,
so that it may be used if necessary for a subsequent
.IR kill .
.SS Termination reporting
If a command (not followed by `&') terminates abnormally,
a message is printed.
All terminations other than exit and interrupt
are considered abnormal.
Termination reports for commands followed by `&'
are given upon receipt of the first command
subsequent to its termination,
or when the
.B wait
special command is executed.
The following is a list of the abnormal termination messages:
.PP
.RS 6n
Hangup
.br
Quit
.br
Illegal instruction
.br
Trace/BPT trap
.br
IOT trap
.br
EMT trap
.br
Floating exception
.br
Killed
.br
Bus error
.br
Memory fault
.br
Bad system call
.RE
.PP
If a core image is produced,
`\-\- Core dumped' is appended to the appropriate message.
.SS I/O redirection
There are three character sequences which cause the immediately
following string to be interpreted as a special argument to the
shell itself.
Such a redirection may appear anywhere among the
arguments of a simple command,
or before or after a parenthesized command list,
and is associated with that command or command list.
.PP
A redirection of the form `<arg' causes the file `arg'
to be used as the standard input (file descriptor 0)
for the associated command.
.PP
A redirection of the form `>arg' causes the file `arg'
to be used as the standard output (file descriptor 1)
for the associated command.
If `arg' does not exist, it is created;
otherwise, it is truncated at the outset.
.PP
A redirection of the form `>>arg' is the same as `>arg',
except if `arg' exists the command output is
appended to the end of the file.
.PP
For example, either of the following command lines:
.PP
.RS 6n
date >/tmp/list; ls \-l >>/tmp/list
.br
( date; ls \-l ) >/tmp/list
.RE
.PP
creates, on file `/tmp/list', the current date and time,
followed by a long listing of the current directory.
.PP
A `>' or `>>' redirection
associated with any but the last command of a pipeline
is ineffectual, as is a `<' with any but the first.
.PP
The standard error (file descriptor 2)
is not subject to redirection by the shell.
Thus, commands may write diagnostics
to a location where they have a
chance to be seen.
.SS Quoting
The character `\\' causes the immediately following character
to lose any special meaning it may have to the shell; in this
way `<', `>', and other characters meaningful to the
shell may be passed as part of arguments.
A special case of this feature allows the continuation of commands
onto more than one line:  a newline preceded by `\\' is translated
into a blank.
.PP
Sequences of characters enclosed in double (") or single (')
quotes are also taken literally.
For example:
.PP
.RS 6n
awk '{print NR "\\t" $0}' My_File ^ more
.RE
.PP
causes
.I awk
to write `My_File',
preceding each line with its line number and a tab,
to the standard output which is piped to
.I more
for viewing.
The quotes prevent the shell from trying to interpret any part
of the string, which is then given as a single argument to awk.
.SS Parameter substitution
When the shell is invoked as a non-interactive command,
it has additional string processing capabilities not available
when interactive.
If the shell is invoked in the following form:
.PP
.RS 6n
sh6 name [arg1 ...]
.RE
.PP
.I name
is either taken as one of the shell options,
or as the name of a
.I "command file"
which is opened as the standard input of the shell.
.PP
In both cases,
the shell reads and interprets
command lines from its standard input.
In each command line,
unquoted character sequences of the form `$N', where
.I N
is a digit,
are substituted with the \fIN\fRth argument to the invocation
of the shell (\fIargn\fR).
`$0' is substituted with
.IR name .
.PP
In both interactive and non-interactive shells, `$$'
is substituted with the process ID of this instance
of the shell.
.PP
All substitution on a command line occurs
.I before
the line is interpreted.
Thus, no action which alters the value of any parameter can have any
effect on a reference to that parameter occurring on the
.I same
line.
.SS File name generation
Following parameter substitution,
any argument containing unquoted `*', `?', or `[' characters
is treated specially as follows.
The current directory is searched for files which
.I match
the given argument.
The file name components `.' and `..', and the `/' character,
are normally excluded from matches and must be matched explicitly.
.PP
The character `*' in an argument matches any string of characters
in a file name (including the null string).
.PP
The character `?' matches any single character in a file name.
.PP
Square brackets `[...]' specify a class of characters which
matches any single file name character in the class.
Within the brackets,
each ordinary character is taken
to be a member of the class.
A pair of characters separated by `\-' places
in the class
each character lexically greater than or equal to
the first and less than or equal to the second
member of the pair.
.PP
For example, `*' matches all file names;
`?' matches all one-character file names; `[ab]*.s' matches
all file names beginning with `a' or `b' and ending with `.s';
`?[zi\-m]' matches all two-character file names ending
with `z' or the letters `i' through `m'.
.PP
If the argument with `*', `?', or `[' also contains a `/', a slightly
different procedure is used:  instead of the current directory,
the directory used is the one obtained by taking the argument up
to the last `/' before a `*', `?', or `['.
The matching process matches the remainder of the argument
after this `/' against the files in the derived directory.
For example:  `/usr/dmr/a*.s' matches all files
in directory `/usr/dmr' which begin
with `a' and end with `.s'.
.PP
In any event, a list of names is obtained which match
the argument.
This list is sorted into alphabetical order,
and the resulting sequence of arguments replaces the
single argument containing the `*', `?', or `['.
The same process is carried out for each argument
(the resulting lists are
.I not
merged)
and finally the command is executed with the resulting list of
arguments.
.PP
If a command has one argument with `*', `?', or `[',
a diagnostic is printed if that argument fails
to match any files.
If a command has several such arguments,
a diagnostic is printed if they
.I all
fail to match any files.
.SS End of file
An end-of-file in the shell's input causes it to exit.
If interactive, this means the shell exits when the
user types an EOF character (often represented by `^D')
at the beginning of a line.
.SS Special commands
The following commands are executed by the shell without
creating a new process.
Attempts to pipe, redirect, or run these commands
asynchronously are ignored.
.TP
\fB:\fR [\fIarg ...\fR]
Does nothing; exit status is set to zero.
This command can be used to place labels for the
.I goto
command or to add commentary to command files,
among other things.
.TP
\fBchdir\fR \fIdir\fR
Changes the shell's working directory to
.IR dir .
.TP
.B exit
Terminates a non-interactive shell which is reading
commands from a file.
The exit status is that of the last command executed.
.TP
\fBlogin\fR [\fIarg ...\fR]
Replaces an interactive shell with an instance of
.IR login (1).
.TP
.B shift
Shift is used in command files to shift all of
the positional parameters to the left by 1, so that
old `$2' can now be referred to by `$1' and so forth.
Shift has no effect on `$0'.
.TP
.B wait
Waits until all processes created with `&' have completed,
reporting on any abnormal terminations.
.SS Signals (+)
If the shell is interactive,
it ignores the SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and SIGTERM
signals (see
.IR signal (3)).
However, if the shell has been invoked with any
option argument,
it only ignores SIGINT and SIGQUIT.
.PP
If SIGINT or SIGQUIT is already ignored
when the shell starts,
it is also ignored for child processes of the shell.
Otherwise, both signals are reset to their
default actions for child processes.
SIGTERM is also reset to its default action.
.PP
For all other signals,
the shell inherits the signal state from its
parent process and passes it to its children.
.PP
Processes created with `&' ignore both the
SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals.
If such a process has not redirected its
input with a `<',
the shell automatically redirects it from
.IR /dev/null .
.SH "EXIT STATUS (+)"
The exit status of the shell is that of the
last command executed prior to an EOF or
.BR exit .
.PP
If the shell is interactive and detects an error,
it exits with a non-zero status if the user
types an EOF at the next prompt.
.PP
Otherwise, if the shell is non-interactive and
is reading commands from a file,
any shell-detected error causes the shell
to cease execution of that file.
This results in a non-zero exit status.
.PP
A non-zero exit status from the shell may be
one of the following values:
.TP
1
A common shell-detected error occurred,
such as a `syntax\ error'.
.TP
2
A fatal shell-detected error occurred.
.TP
126
An external command was found but could not be executed
by the shell.
.TP
127
An external command was not found.
.TP
>128
A signal was received.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.BR PATH \ (+)
Is the sequence of directories used by the shell to search
for external commands.

.SH AUTHORS
This implementation of the shell is derived from osh-020214
by Gunnar Ritter.
The current maintainer,
and author of new code,
is Jeffrey Allen Neitzel.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
This implementation of the shell is intended to be
backward compatible with the behaviour of
.IR sh (1)
from Sixth Edition
.SM UNIX.
.PP
However, there are in fact several minor differences.
For reliability and usability on modern
.SM UNIX
systems,
several instances of undesirable behaviour found
in the original have been purposely changed.
At the same time,
several other shell oddities have been purposely left
in place as they are documented and can be quite useful.
.PP
When it is known to differ in some way from the original,
this fact is marked throughout the manual
by a `(+)' symbol.
Otherwise,
the only remaining difference not mentioned elsewhere
is that this implementation can handle 8-bit character sets,
whereas the original can only handle 7-bit ASCII.
.SH HISTORY
The Thompson shell, by Ken Thompson of Bell Labs, was used as the
standard command interpreter through Sixth Edition
.SM UNIX.
In the Seventh Edition,
it was replaced by the Bourne shell and then made available as
.IR osh .
.SH NOTES
.I Sh6
has no facilities for setting, unsetting, or otherwise
manipulating environment variables within the shell.
This must be accomplished by using other tools such as
.IR env (1).
.PP
In general,
since the shell does not read any startup files,
it should not be added to the shell database
(see
.IR shells (5))
unless the system administrator is willing
to deal with this simple fact.
.PP
Notice that some shell oddities have historically been
undocumented in this manual page.
Particularly noteworthy is the fact that there is no such thing
as a usage error when invoking the shell.
For example, the following are all perfectly legal:
.PP
.RS 6n
sh6 -cats_are_nice!!! ': "Good kitty =)"'
.br
sh6 -tabbies_are_too!
.br
sh6 -s
.RE
.PP
The first two cases correspond to the
.B \-c
and
.B \-t
options
respectively;
the third case corresponds to the
.B \-
option.
.SH BUGS
The shell offers no way to redirect the diagnostic output.
.PP
The shell makes no attempt to recover from
.IR read (2)
errors and exits with a status of 2 if this system call fails.
