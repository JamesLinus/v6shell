NAME
	run.osh - run regression test suite with osh and sh6

SYNOPSIS
	../osh run.osh [-newlog] {osh | sh6}

DESCRIPTION
	The -newlog option causes run.osh to generate new test logs
	for the osh and sh6 regression test suite.  Otherwise, it
	simply runs the regression test suite with osh and sh6.

EXIT STATUS
	The run.osh script exits with a zero status (true) when
	all tests pass.  It exits with a non-zero status (false)
	when any tests fail.
