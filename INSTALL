Build and install instructions for osh!

--------
SYNOPSIS
	env [variable=value ...] make [target ...]
	make [variable=value ...] [target ...]

If the defaults described below match your desires and/or the
requirements of your system, you can build and install the entire
osh package by doing the following.

	% make
	# make install

...
Otherwise, continue reading for full build and install details.
See the EXAMPLES section at the end of this file for additional
help if needed.

---------
VARIABLES
The Makefile defines the following configuration variables (default
value listed).  The user can modify the default configuration by
passing the desired variable=value pair(s) on the command line.

	DESTDIR		Unset by default.  This may be used as a
			target directory for building/packaging
			binary packages if needed.

	PREFIX		Defaults to /usr/local.  This is the target
			directory where BINDIR, DOCDIR, MANDIR, and
			SYSCONFDIR are located by default.

	BINDIR		Defaults to $(PREFIX)/bin.  This is the target
			directory where the binaries are installed.

	DOCDIR		Defaults to $(PREFIX)/share/doc/$(OSH_VERSION).
			This is the target directory for the [ACILNPR]*
			package documentation files.

	EXPDIR		Defaults to $(DOCDIR)/examples.  This is the
			target directory for the examples/* files.

	MANDIR		Defaults to $(PREFIX)/share/man/man1.  This is
			the target directory where the manual pages are
			installed.

	SYSCONFDIR	Defaults to $(PREFIX)/etc.  This is the target
			directory where the shell shall search for its
			system-wide rc (init and logout) files if such
			files are available on the system.  See also:

				http://v6shell.org/rc_files

			...
			for example rc files.

	INSTALL		Defaults to /usr/bin/install.  The install(1)
			utility is used to copy the resulting binaries,
			manual pages, and other files to final targets.

Mac OS X only:
The following configuration variable specifies the desired target
architecture(s) for compiling universal binaries and/or 64-bit
binaries and/or 32-bit binaries for Mac OS X running on Intel
and PowerPC Macs.

	MOXARCH		Unset by default.  Possible value(s) may include
			one or more of the following on supported systems:
			-arch x86_64, -arch ppc64, -arch i386, -arch ppc.
			See also EXAMPLES.

-------
TARGETS
The following targets are available.

	all		Default target is the same as typing `make'.
			Compiles everything and generates manual pages.

	oshall		Compiles osh and generates manual pages.

	sh6all		Compiles sh6, glob6, if, goto, fd2 and
			generates manual pages.

	install		Installs all binaries and manual pages.

	install-oshall	Installs osh binary and manual pages.

	install-sh6all	Installs sh6all binaries and manual pages.

	install-doc	Installs package documentation.

	install-exp	Installs examples.

	clean-obj	Removes all object files.

	clean		Removes all binaries, object files, and other
			files generated during the build.

--------
EXAMPLES
The following compiles osh for /opt/local.
Then, it installs the osh binary into /opt/local/bin, manual pages
into /opt/local/share/man/man1, package documentation and examples
into /opt/local/share/doc/$(OSH_VERSION), and also sets SYSCONFDIR
to /opt/local/etc.

	% make PREFIX=/opt/local oshall
	# make PREFIX=/opt/local install-oshall install-doc install-exp

The following compiles sh6, glob6, if, goto, and fd2 for /usr/pkg.
Then, it installs these binaries into /usr/pkg/bin, manual pages
into /usr/pkg/share/man/man1, and package documentation into
/usr/pkg/share/doc/$(OSH_VERSION).

	% make PREFIX=/usr/pkg sh6all
	# make PREFIX=/usr/pkg install-sh6all install-doc

The following compiles everything, configuring the shell to search
for its system-wide rc files in /etc instead of /usr/local/etc by
default.  Then, it installs the entire osh package, including package
documentation and examples, into the default location.

	% make SYSCONFDIR=/etc
	# make install install-doc install-exp

The following compiles each program as a 2-way 32-bit universal
binary for Mac OS X running on Intel and PowerPC Macs.  Then, it
installs the entire osh package, including package documentation
and examples, into the default location.

	% make MOXARCH='-arch i386 -arch ppc'
	# make install install-doc install-exp

The following compiles and installs the entire osh package, including
package documentation and examples, into the default location on
OpenSolaris.

	% uname -srvm
	SunOS 5.11 snv_111b i86pc
	% which cc gmake ginstall
	/usr/gnu/bin/cc
	/usr/bin/gmake
	/usr/bin/ginstall
	% gmake
	# gmake INSTALL=/usr/bin/ginstall install install-doc install-exp
