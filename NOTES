This implementation is intended to be compatible with the behaviour
of sh(1) from Sixth Edition (V6) Unix.  However, it is not fully
compatible at the present time.  It is getting closer though as I
find compatibility problems and fix them.

At the same time, this implementation is mostly compatible with
osh(1) from Seventh Edition (V7) Unix.  Both shells were largely
the same, but the version in V7 had a few changes/improvements.
The changes were quite minimal though.

The intention is to make this version of osh as usable as it would
have been if it were running on V6.  The strange thing is that the
system changes between V6 and V7 made osh less usable for running
command files (scripts) than it had previously been.  This is because
the if(1), goto(1), and exit(1) utilities were not distributed with
V7.  Also, glob(8) which had previously lived in /etc/glob was no
longer available on V7.

It was largely due to the existence of these utilities that shell
programming was possible at all; without them the shell was just a
command interpreter.  Especially, without glob(8) it would have
been virtually useless in my opinion.

The "if" and "goto" utilities, as well as "exit", are included in
this version of osh.  The "exit" utility has been implemented here
as a built-in command.  "glob" uses glob(3) from the C library.
