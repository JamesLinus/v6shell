Historical notes:

The Thompson shell, by Ken Thompson of Bell Labs, was used as the
standard command interpreter through Sixth Edition Unix.  In the
Seventh Edition, it was replaced by the Bourne shell and then made
available as osh.

The Sixth Edition Unix shell used the following external utilities.

	1) /bin/exit was used to terminate command files.

	2) /bin/goto was used to transfer the shell's control
	   from one point to another within a command file.

	3) /bin/if was used to evaluate conditional expressions.
	   This is the predecessor to test(1) which was first
	   released in Seventh Edition Unix.

	4) /etc/glob was used to expand `*', `?', and `['
	   in command arguments.

All of the utilities mentioned above are included here.  The "exit"
utility is implemented here as a special built-in command.  "glob"
is built into the shell and uses glob(3) from the C library.

Of course, you can refer to the manual pages for if(1) and goto(1)
for further details on those utilities.

Compatibility notes:

This implementation of the shell is intended to be backward compatible
with the behaviour of sh(1) from Sixth Edition Unix.

However, there are in fact several minor differences.  For
predictability, reliability, and usability on modern systems, several
of the unspecified (or otherwise vague) aspects of the original
have been changed.  That said, backward compatibility is still the
primary goal.  When this implementation of the shell is not backward
compatible in fact, it is fully intended to be backward compatible
in spirit.

When it is known to differ in some way from the original, this fact
is indicated in the appropriate manual page, osh(1) or sh6(1).  Some
of the most obvious differences are further detailed below.  Aside
from those detailed either in the manual pages or below, the only
remaining difference is that this implementation can handle 8-bit
character sets, whereas the original can only handle 7-bit ASCII.

Note that by default, osh(1) runs with enhancements enabled.  If
you wish only compatible behaviour, running the following commands
in an interactive shell or from an initialization file:

	setenv OSH_COMPAT clone
	set clone

...
makes it more compatible with both the original and sh6(1).

Further details on some of the known differences:

1) This implementation of the shell uses PATH to search for external
   commands; the original always uses the equivalent of `.:/bin:/usr/bin'.
   The sh(1) manual page from Sixth Edition Unix says:

       If  the  first argument is the name of an executable file,
       it is invoked; otherwise the string `/bin/'  is  prepended
       to  the  argument.   (In  this way most standard commands,
       which reside in `/bin', are found.)  If no such command is
       found,  the  string  `/usr'  is further prepended (to give
       `/usr/bin/command') and another attempt is made to execute
       the resulting file.  (Certain lesser-used commands live in
       `/usr/bin'.)

       If a non-directory file has executable mode, but  not  the
       form  of  an  executable  program (does not begin with the
       proper magic number) then it is assumed  to  be  an  ASCII
       file of commands and a new Shell is created to execute it.
       See ``Argument passing'' below.

...

   The primary reason this implementation of the shell uses PATH
   instead of a procedure like that described above is primarily
   for both user convenience and security.  In today's world, the
   behaviour described above can conceivably be quite dangerous as
   an unchangeable default.

   Using PATH allows the user to choose the desired search behaviour.
   If behaviour similar to that of the original is desired, the
   user can set PATH to `.:/bin:/usr/bin'.

   Also, this implementation of the shell does not deal with
   executable ASCII files in the same way as the original.  Instead,
   it lets the system's execvp() function determine what to do in
   such a case.  Assuming that the system is POSIX-compliant,
   execvp() executes the ASCII file with the system's sh(1) utility.

2) This implementation of the shell ignores the first line of a
   command file if it begins with `#!' in order to play nicely with
   the kernel's `#!' mechanism.  For example, the first line might
   be `#!/usr/local/bin/osh'.  This is just for user convenience.

3) The original implementation of the shell does shell accounting
   to record command execution data; this one does not.
