Historical notes:
The Sixth Edition Unix shell used the following external utilities.

	1) /bin/exit was used to terminate command files.

	2) /bin/goto was used to transfer the shell's control
	   from one point to another within a command file.

	3) /bin/if was used to evaluate conditional expressions.
	   This is the predecessor to test(1) which was first
	   released in Seventh Edition Unix.

	4) /etc/glob was used to expand `*', `?', and `['
	   in command arguments.

All of the utilities mentioned above are included in this version
of osh.  The "exit" utility is implemented as a built-in command.
"glob" is built into the shell by using glob(3) from the C library.

Compatibility notes:

This implementation of the shell is intended to be backward compatible
with the behaviour of sh(1) from Sixth Edition Unix.  However, there
are a few minor differences, the primary one being that this version
can handle 8-bit character sets, whereas the original can only
handle 7-bit ASCII.

Another  noteworthy  difference is that this version can read
initialization files, whereas the original cannot.

By default, the shell runs with enhancements enabled.  If you wish
only compatible behaviour, running the following commands in an
interactive shell or from an initialization file:

	setenv OSH_COMPAT clone
	set clone

...
makes it fully-compatible with the Sixth Edition Unix shell.
