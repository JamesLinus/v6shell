This implementation intends to take the behaviour of osh on V7 and
treat it as sh on V6.  Both shells are largely the same, but the
version in V7 had a few changes/improvements.  The changes were
quite minimal.

The intention is to make osh as usable as it would have been if it
were running on V6.  The system changes between V6 and V7 made osh
less usable for running command files (scripts) than it had previously
been.  This is because the if(1), goto(1), and exit(1) utilities
were not distributed with V7.

It was largely due to the existence of these utilities that shell
programming was possible at all; without them the shell was just a
command interpreter.

The "if" and "goto" utilities, as well as "exit", are included in
this version of osh.  The "exit" utility has been implemented here
in a built-in form.
