Historical notes:
The Sixth Edition Unix shell used the following external utilities.

	1) /bin/exit was used to terminate command files.

	2) /bin/goto was used to transfer the shell's control
	   from one point to another within a command file.

	3) /bin/if was used to evaluate conditional expressions.
	   This is the predecessor to test(1) which was first
	   released in Seventh Edition Unix.

	4) /etc/glob was used to expand `*', `?', and `['
	   in command arguments.

All of the utilities mentioned above are included in this version
of osh.  The "exit" utility is implemented as a built-in command.
"glob" is built into the shell by using glob(3) from the C library.

--------
Compatibility notes:
This implementation of the shell is intended to be compatible with
the behaviour of sh(1) from Sixth Edition Unix.  However, there are
a few minor differences, the primary one being that this version
can handle 8-bit character sets, whereas the original can only
handle 7-bit ASCII.

The last major incompatibility is related to parameter substitution.
The Sixth Edition Unix shell did parameter substitution while reading
a command from input.  So, substitution happened before any parsing
or execution took place.  This implementation of the shell differs
in that it does not do parameter substitution until the execution
stage.  Here is just one example of an effect of this difference.

--------
Example:
The following command file will give different results depending
on which shell is used.

: Begin runcom

$1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9

: End runcom

Running this command file with this version of osh:

% osh runcom echo hello \| grep h \; echo hello again
hello | grep h ; echo hello again

Running this command file with sh on V6, or osh on V7:

% osh runcom echo hello \| grep h \; echo hello again
hello
hello again
