The original Thompson shell was principally written by Ken Thompson
of Bell Labs.  However, it should be noted that other individuals
at Bell Labs also had a role in its development: Dennis Ritchie,
Doug McIlroy, and quite probably others whose names I do not know.

Jeffrey Allen Neitzel is the principal developer and maintainer of
the enhanced, backward-compatible port of the Sixth Edition Thompson
shell (and all of the other software) released in this package.
Notice that I have developed two different variations of osh(1)
since July 2003.  The origin of each one is described below.

[osh-030730 through osh-060124]:
	The first variation was originally authored by Gunnar Ritter as
	osh-020214/osh.c and was then adopted by Jeffrey Allen Neitzel.

	Unfortunately, the design of Gunnar's implementation was broken.
	Thus, it required a lot of workarounds in order to fix the fact
	that his design resulted in a shell which was simply incompatible
	with the Thompson shell.

	I modified Gunnar's design to separate command-line parsing and
	execution so that the shell could at least be compatible in the
	most basic sense.  The only catch was that word splitting was still
	incompatible.  Thus, this partial solution was always destined for
	eventual replacement.

[osh-20061230 through osh-current]:
	The second variation was originally authored by Ken Thompson as
	Sixth Edition Unix /usr/source/s2/sh.c and was then ported by
	Jeffrey Allen Neitzel for personal use in January 2004.

	I eventually released it as sh6(1) in osh-060124.  Then, after its
	release, I quickly realized that the design of the original shell
	(see: osh-060124/*6.c) offered a far better starting point for
	making osh(1) truly backward-compatible with the Thompson shell.

	Bothered by the fact that osh(1) still got word splitting wrong, I
	abandoned the design used in the first variation, adapted sh6.c and
	glob6.c, copied them to osh.c, and began working on it during my
	free time in 2006.  Finally, I released the new variation of osh(1)
	in osh-20061230.

...
I wish to thank the original authors very much for their efforts.
Without their previous work, none of this software or documentation
would exist today.
