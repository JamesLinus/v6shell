[030730]:
	* Initial maintenance release by Jeffrey Allen Neitzel
osh.c:
	* Add '#ifdef CLONE' so the desired command search behaviour
	  can be chosen at build time.
	* Fixed segfault when command line contains only whitespace.
	  We simply ignore this situation now.
	* Fixed segfault when redirections are used w/o a command.
	  This will now result in a syntax error.
	* Fixed segfault when redirecting a command w/o a filename.
	  This will now result in a syntax error.
	* Fixed a small memory leak when using redirection arguments.
	* Make osh correctly detect when a command line contains
	  too many arguments.  This allows command lines to have a
	  maximum of 255 arguments.
if.c:
	* Add '#ifdef CLONE' to make if(1) search for external commands
	  the same way osh(1) does.
goto.c:
	* Fixed a bug where goto should produce a 'label not found' error
	  but would instead go into an infinite loop at the end of the
	  command file.  We now correctly detect EOF and successfully
	  report 'label not found' errors.
