Changes which are strictly for compatibility with the original
implementations are marked w/ a 'C:' in the details below.  Other
changes may also improve compatibility as a side-effect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[031112]:
Makefile:
	* Added a test to ensure that the installation directories exist.
	  Create them if they are missing.

osh.c:
	* C: Reverted some previous changes to abnormal termination messages.
	     Specifically, the original on V6 used signal numbers instead of
	     "Alarm clock" and "Terminated".

	* C: When printing termination reports for asynchronous commands
	     also print the process ID w/ the message.

	* Made changes/improvements to the detection of syntax errors for
	  malformed pipelines.  These syntax checks are done before actually
	  creating any pipes; otherwise, there will be file descriptor leakage
	  and possibly bad behaviour when command line has bad syntax.

	* Fixed a file descriptor leak caused when user hits, or would exceed,
	  the limit for maximum number of processes.

	* Added a missing newline to the 'Cannot pipe' error message.

	* Changed the prototype for xchdir() and made associated changes;
	  only pass args[1] instead of the entire argument vector.

	* Avoid needless function calls when command line contains only
	  blanks (spaces, tabs) by stripping them away first.

	* Added code to make command files terminate when any of the commands
	  cannot be executed, cannot be found, or terminate with a signal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[031014+]:
	The only noteworthy changes in this version are to the commentary
	in Makefile, NOTES, README, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[031014]:
LICENSE:
	* Added additional license for code which I've written.

osh.c:
	* Added an additional copyright notice.

	* Changed a char *pointer to a const char *pointer since it is
	  only used for string constants.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[031012]:
	A lot of the changes in this version are related to compatibility
	with the behaviour of the original implementations from V6 and V7.
	In addition, the manual pages for "if" and "goto" have been changed
	to use man macros instead of escape sequences wherever possible
	as well as improving the appearance of the formatted output for
	the if(1) manual page.

osh.c:
	* C: Write the prompt to stderr instead of stdout.

	* C: Added an exit command to terminate command files.

	* C: Make the 'login' command only work in interactive shells and
	     give an error message if not interactive.

	* C: Changed the '>' and '>>' error message to 'cannot create'
	     instead of 'cannot open'.

	* C: Make '>>' create the file if it does not already exist.

	* C: Added a 'shift: no args' error message for the 'shift' command
	     when there is nothing to shift.

	* C: Added "Hangup", "Alarm clock", and "Terminated" to the abnormal
	     termination messages that osh reports.  This matches osh on V7.

	* C: Added code to properly report the abnormal termination status of
	     asynchronous commands (&) upon receipt of the next command.  This
	     was documented in the V6 sh(1) manual page.

	* Fixed a problem where terminated children (zombies) could get in the
	  way and render the shell unusable when the user reached hard or soft
	  process limit.  The shell's 'wait' command was, and still is, an
	  effective way to exorcise these zombies.  Although, this should
	  be less necessary now that the above feature is implemented.

	* Avoid an infinite loop and give an error when the shell loses its
	  input.  An easy way to reproduce this is to close standard input
	  from another shell w/ redirection.

	* Merged in code I use which makes 'chdir' more like 'cd' in modern
	  shells by allowing 'chdir' to HOME, 'chdir -' to previous, and
	  'chdir dir' to any other directory.  You can always define CLONE
	  in the Makefile to compile w/ the original behaviour if you wish.

	* Ignore '#!' at the beginning of command files.  This is just for
	  convenience.  The original did not do this, but it makes sense since
	  this implementation differs from the original by not taking any extra
	  steps to feed executable text files to osh directly.  Let the kernel
	  do this for us.

if.c:
	* C: Added an exit command.

	* Added a 'cannot fork' error message.

	* Error messages are now written to stderr, not stdout.

	* Changed the '-r' and '-w' tests to use access(2) instead of open(2).
	  This makes the '-w' test give correct results for directories where
	  it previously failed to do so.

	* Match the documentation and give an error when the command in
	  '{ command }' is another 'if'.

	* Temporarily removed the '-c' primitive from the code since it
	  is undocumented and does not appear to do anything useful.

goto.c:
	* Fixed a buffer overflow caused when the label was too long.
	  It looks like this bug has been there since goto was written
	  back in the 1970s.  Also, reduced the maximum size of the buffer
	  to 128 characters instead of LINE_MAX characters.

	* Added a 'label too long' error message to go with the above fix.

	* Error messages are now written to stderr, not stdout.

	* Replaced all of the gotos with while loops for the sake of clarity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[030811]:
osh.c:
	* Fixed bug introduced in previous release by declaring array
	  with incorrect size.  This array is now dynamically allocated.

if.c:
	* Added code to check and enforce maximum number of arguments.

goto.c:
	* Completely fixed detection of EOF in command files.
	  The reason for these EOF problems was because getchar(3) in
	  V6 Unix indicated end-of-file with '\0', and of course this
	  is no longer the case today.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[030730]:
	* This is the initial maintenance release by Jeffrey Allen Neitzel.

osh.c:
	* Added '#ifdef CLONE' so the desired command search behaviour
	  can be chosen at build time.

	* Fixed segfault when command line contains only whitespace.
	  We simply ignore this situation now.

	* Fixed segfault when redirections are used w/o a command.
	  This will now result in a syntax error.

	* Fixed segfault when redirecting a command w/o a filename.
	  This will now result in a syntax error.

	* Fixed a small memory leak when using redirection arguments.

	* Made osh correctly detect when a command line contains
	  too many arguments.  This allows command lines to have a
	  maximum of 255 arguments.

if.c:
	* Added '#ifdef CLONE' to make if(1) search for external commands
	  the same way osh(1) does.

goto.c:
	* Fixed a bug where goto should produce a 'label not found' error
	  but would instead go into an infinite loop at the end of the
	  command file.  We now correctly detect EOF and successfully
	  report 'label not found' errors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[020214]:
	* All versions of osh prior to and including 020214 were authored
	  and maintained by Gunnar Ritter.  He also ported "if" and "goto"
	  from Sixth Edition Unix sources.
