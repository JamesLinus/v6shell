Welcome to osh-current (20071125)!

Osh(1) is an enhanced, backward-compatible port of the Sixth Edition (V6)
Unix shell (circa 1975), also known as the Thompson shell.  The original
Thompson shell was principally written by Ken Thompson of Bell Labs.

Sh6(1) (a port of the original shell) and glob6(1) (a port of the
global command) are also included in this package.  Together, they
provide a user interface which is backward compatible with that
provided by the Sixth Edition Thompson shell and global command,
but without the obvious enhancements found in osh.

Notice that this package also includes the following shell utilities:

	if(1)   - conditional command (ported from Sixth Edition Unix)

	goto(1) - transfer command (ported from Sixth Edition Unix)

	fd2(1)  - redirect file descriptor 2
