Welcome to osh!

The osh package provides two ports of the original /bin/sh from
Sixth Edition (V6) UNIX (circa 1975).

Osh(1) is an enhanced, backward-compatible port of the Sixth Edition
Thompson shell.  Sh6(1) is an unenhanced port of the shell, and
glob6(1) is a port of its global command.  Together, sh6 and glob6
provide a user interface which is backward compatible with that
provided by the Sixth Edition Thompson shell and global command,
but without the obvious enhancements found in osh.

The original Thompson shell was principally written by Ken Thompson
of Bell Labs.

Notice that this package also includes the following shell utilities:

	if(1)   - conditional command (ported from Sixth Edition UNIX)

	goto(1) - transfer command (ported from Sixth Edition UNIX)

	fd2(1)  - redirect from/to file descriptor 2

-------
See the INSTALL file for build and install instructions.

-------
The osh package should build successfully on any POSIX-compliant
UNIX system.  It has been reported to build successfully on the
following systems:

	System		Releases / Distributions / Additional Info
	----------------------------------------------------------
	DragonFly BSD	2.0.1
	FreeBSD		6.1, 7.0
	Mac OS X	10.4, 10.5
	NetBSD		2.1, 3.1.1, 4.0, 4.0.1
	OpenBSD		4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
	OpenSolaris	2008.05, 2008.11
	GNU/Linux	CentOS 5.2, Debian testing (lenny), Kubuntu,
			Mandriva 2007.0, Slackware 12.1, Xubuntu

If your system is not reported above, simply try to build the osh
package to see if it works or not.  In either case, please report
the results to the developer if possible.  The resulting "config.h"
file and the compiler name/version is most helpful.

Please send osh bug reports to <bugs (at) v6shell (dot) org>.  Before
reporting a bug, please try to reproduce it with the latest version
of the code.  With bug reports, please try to ensure that enough
information to reproduce the problem is enclosed.  Also, if a known
fix for it exists, then please include that as well.

If you have any comments or questions about this software, I encourage
you to contact me via email.  Thanks & Enjoy!
