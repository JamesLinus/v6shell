Welcome to osh, an old shell!  This is version 031112.

This is a reimplementation of the Sixth Edition Unix shell.  The
original implementation was written by Ken Thompson at Bell Labs.
The software contained here descends directly from osh-020214 by
Gunnar Ritter and includes the "if" and "goto" commands which he
ported from Sixth Edition Unix sources.  See the manual pages for
additional details.

Building and installing osh is quite simple.
The following steps will suffice in the normal case:

1) Adjust the CONFIGURATION section in the Makefile to match
   your desires and/or the requirements of your system.
2) Type `make' to compile osh, if, and goto.
3) Type `make install' to install the binaries and manual pages.

Osh is currently developed and maintained on NetBSD and OpenBSD.
It is also known to work correctly on FreeBSD.  To the best of my
knowledge it should build on most any Unix system, but I have not
verified this as I do not have access to other operating systems.
I welcome reports of success or failure to build it on other systems.

If you find a bug, please send a bug report to me at the following
email address.  Please include all relevant information needed to
reproduce the problem.  If I can reproduce it I will fix it.  Of
course, if you fix the bug yourself please send me a patch. =)

If you have any other questions about this software, I encourage
you to contact me via email.  Enjoy!
