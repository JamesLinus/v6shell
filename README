Welcome to osh, an old shell!  This is version 040628.

This is an enhanced, backward-compatible reimplementation of the
Sixth Edition Unix shell.  The original implementation was written
by Ken Thompson of Bell Labs.  The software contained herein descends
directly from osh-020214 by Gunnar Ritter.  See the manual pages
for additional details.

The NOTES file gives additional information about this implementation
of osh, including some historical and compatibility notes.

--------
INSTALL:
The following steps will normally suffice to build/install osh:

1) Adjust the CONFIGURATION section in the Makefile to match
   your desires and/or the requirements of your system.

2) Type `make' to compile osh, if, and goto.

3) Optionally, type `make check' to run a minimal test suite.
   *) This should be done as a regular user, not the superuser.

4) Type `make install' to install the binaries and manual pages.

If you also want the fd2 utility:

5) Type `make fd2' to compile it.

6) Type `make install-fd2' to install it and its manual page.

--------
Osh is currently developed and maintained on NetBSD and OpenBSD.
It is also known to work correctly on FreeBSD.  To the best of my
knowledge it should build on most any POSIX-compliant Unix system,
but I have not verified this as I do not have access to other
operating systems.  I welcome reports of success or failure to
build it on other systems.

If you find a bug, please send a bug report to me at the following
email address.  Please include all relevant information needed to
reproduce the problem.  If I can reproduce it I will fix it.  Of
course, if you fix the bug yourself please send me a patch. =)

If you have any other questions about this software, I encourage
you to contact me via email.  Enjoy!
