Welcome to osh, an old shell!  This is version 040216.

This is a reimplementation of the Sixth Edition Unix shell.  The
original implementation was written by Ken Thompson at Bell Labs.
The software contained here descends directly from osh-020214 by
Gunnar Ritter and includes the "if" and "goto" commands which he
ported from Sixth Edition Unix sources.  See the manual pages for
additional details.

The NOTES file briefly describes some of the major differences
between this implementation of osh and Ken Thompson's.  It also
gives some potentially useful additional information about this
implementation.

--------
INSTALL:
Note that there is a patch available for this version.  It is not
necessary, but you may wish to read and/or apply SIGTSTP.patch
before building osh.  I use it myself, but take your pick depending
on your preferences.

The following steps will normally suffice to build/install osh:

1) Adjust the CONFIGURATION section in the Makefile to match
   your desires and/or the requirements of your system.
2) Type `make' to compile osh, if, and goto.
3) Optionally, type `make check' to run a minimal test suite.
4) Type `make install' to install the binaries and manual pages.

--------
Osh is currently developed and maintained on NetBSD and OpenBSD.
It is also known to work correctly on FreeBSD.  To the best of my
knowledge it should build on most any POSIX-compliant Unix system,
but I have not verified this as I do not have access to other
operating systems.  I welcome reports of success or failure to
build it on other systems.

If you find a bug, please send a bug report to me at the following
email address.  Please include all relevant information needed to
reproduce the problem.  If I can reproduce it I will fix it.  Of
course, if you fix the bug yourself please send me a patch. =)

If you have any other questions about this software, I encourage
you to contact me via email.  Enjoy!
