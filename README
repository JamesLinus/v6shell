Welcome to release 041018 of osh!

Osh is an enhanced, backward-compatible reimplementation of the
Sixth Edition Unix shell.  The original implementation was written
by Ken Thompson of Bell Labs.  This release of osh was originally
derived from osh-020214 by Gunnar Ritter.

Sh6, a compatible reimplementation of the Sixth Edition Unix shell,
is also included here.  It is basically osh without the enhancements.

The NOTES file gives additional information about this software,
including some historical and compatibility notes.  See the manual
pages for additional details.

--------
INSTALL:
The following steps will normally suffice to build/install osh and
its supporting utilities, if and goto:

1) Adjust the CONFIGURATION section in the Makefile to match
   your desires and/or the requirements of your system.

2) Type `make' to compile osh, if, and goto.

3) Optionally, type `make check' to run a minimal test suite.
   *) This should be done as a regular user, not the superuser.

4) Type `make install' to install the binaries and manual pages.

If you also wish to build/install sh6:

5) Type `make sh6' to compile it.

6) As above, typing `make check-sh6' as a regular user optionally
   runs the tests against the sh6 binary.

7) Type `make install-sh6' to install it and its manual page.

--------
Osh is currently developed and maintained on NetBSD and OpenBSD.
The latest release is always tested and known to work correctly on
these systems and also on FreeBSD.  I have received reports that
previous releases build and work correctly on various distributions
of GNU/Linux as well.

To the best of my knowledge this software should build on most any
POSIX-compliant Unix system, but I have not verified this as I do
not necessarily have access to other operating systems.  However,
I certainly do welcome reports of success or failure to build it
on other systems.

If you think you may have found a bug, before reporting it, please
try to reproduce it with the latest version of the code.  With bug
reports, please try to ensure that enough information to reproduce
the problem is enclosed.  Also, if a known fix for it exists then
please include that as well.  All bug reports should be sent to the
following email address: jneitzel@sdf.lonestar.org

If you have any questions about this software, I encourage you to
contact me via email.  Enjoy!
