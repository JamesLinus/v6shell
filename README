Welcome to osh, an old shell!  This is version 030730.

This is a reimplementation of the Sixth Edition Unix shell.  See
the manual page for details.  The software contained here descends
directly from osh-020214 by Gunnar Ritter and includes the "if" and
"goto" commands ported from Sixth Edition Unix sources.

Building and installing osh is really quite simple.
The following steps should do the job:

1) Adjust the CONFIGURATION section in the Makefile to match
   your desires and/or the requirements of your system.
2) Type `make' to compile.
3) Type `make install' to install.

That's about it.
Enjoy!
