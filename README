Welcome to osh-20081026!

Osh(1) is an enhanced, backward-compatible port of the Sixth Edition (V6)
UNIX shell (circa 1975), also known as the Thompson shell.  The original
Thompson shell was principally written by Ken Thompson of Bell Labs.

Sh6(1) (a port of the original shell) and glob6(1) (a port of the
global command) are also included in this package.  Together, they
provide a user interface which is backward compatible with that
provided by the Sixth Edition Thompson shell and global command,
but without the obvious enhancements found in osh.

Notice that this package also includes the following shell utilities:

	if(1)   - conditional command (ported from Sixth Edition UNIX)

	goto(1) - transfer command (ported from Sixth Edition UNIX)

	fd2(1)  - redirect file descriptor 2

-------
See the INSTALL file for build and install instructions.

-------
The osh package should build successfully on any POSIX-compliant
UNIX system.  It is known to build successfully on the following
systems at the time of this release:

	System		Releases / Distributions / Additional Info
	----------------------------------------------------------
	FreeBSD		6.1, 7.0
	Mac OS X	10.4, 10.5
	NetBSD		2.1, 3.1.1, 4.0
	OpenBSD		4.1, 4.2, 4.3
	OpenSolaris	2008.05
	GNU/Linux	CentOS 5.2, Debian testing (lenny), Kubuntu,
			Mandriva 2007.0, Slackware 12.1, Xubuntu

If your system is not mentioned above, simply try to build the osh
package to see if it works or not.  In either case, please report
the results to the developer if possible.  The resulting "config.h"
file and the compiler name/version is most helpful.

Please send osh bug reports to <bugs (at) v6shell (dot) org>.  Before
reporting a bug, please try to reproduce it with the latest version
of the code.  With bug reports, please try to ensure that enough
information to reproduce the problem is enclosed.  Also, if a known
fix for it exists, then please include that as well.

If you have any comments or questions about this software, I encourage
you to contact me via email.  Thanks & Enjoy!
