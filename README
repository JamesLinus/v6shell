Welcome to release 051030 of osh!

Osh(1) is an enhanced, backward-compatible reimplementation of the
Thompson shell from Sixth Edition Unix (circa 1975).  It is derived
from osh-020214/osh.c, which was written by Gunnar Ritter.  However,
it should be noted that the original implementation of the Thompson
shell was written by Ken Thompson of Bell Labs.

In addition to the shell, which is built as osh by default, this
package also includes:

	sh6(1) - a version of the shell w/o enhancements

	if(1) - conditional command (ported from Sixth Edition Unix)

	goto(1) - transfer command (ported from Sixth Edition Unix)

	fd2(1) - redirect file descriptor 2

The COMPATIBILITY and HISTORY files give additional information
about this software.  See the manual pages for additional details.

--------
INSTALL:
The following steps should suffice to build/install osh and its
supporting utilities, if, goto, and fd2:

	1) Adjust the CONFIGURATION section in the Makefile to match
	   your desires and/or the requirements of your system.

	2) Type `make' to compile osh, if, goto, and fd2.

	3) Optionally, type `make check' to run a minimal test suite.
	   *) This should be done as a regular user, not the superuser.

	4) Type `make install' to install the binaries and manual pages.

If you also wish to build/install sh6:

	5) Type `make sh6' to compile it.

	6) Type `make check-sh6' as a regular user to optionally
	   run the tests against the sh6 binary.

	7) Type `make install-sh6' to install it and its manual page.

--------
This software should build and work correctly on any POSIX-compliant
Unix system.  In particular, it is currently developed, maintained,
and tested by the developer on NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Mac OS X.  In
the past, it has also been successfully tested on FreeBSD and on
various distributions of GNU/Linux.
