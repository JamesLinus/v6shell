Welcome to osh, an old shell!  This is version 031012.

This is a reimplementation of the Sixth Edition Unix shell.  The
original implementation was written by Ken Thompson at Bell Labs.
The software contained here descends directly from osh-020214 by
Gunnar Ritter and includes the "if" and "goto" commands which he
ported from Sixth Edition Unix sources.  See the manual pages for
additional details.

Building and installing osh is really quite simple.
The following steps should do the job:

1) Adjust the CONFIGURATION section in the Makefile to match
   your desires and/or the requirements of your system.
2) Type `make' to compile.
3) Type `make install' to install.

Osh is currently developed, maintained, and known to work correctly
on FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.  To the best of my knowledge it
should build on most any Unix system, but I have not verified this
as I do not have access to other operating systems.  I welcome
reports of success or failure to build it on other systems.

If you find a bug, please send a bug report to me at the following
email address.  Please include all relevant information needed to
reproduce the problem.  If I can reproduce it I will fix it.  Of
course, if you fix the bug yourself please send me a patch.

Also, being that I am human and by definition am less than perfect...
If you notice that I have misinterpreted something about the original
implementation and have stated that something is compatible when
it is not, I do encourage you to contact me about it.

Well, that's about it.
Enjoy!
