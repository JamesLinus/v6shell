Welcome to release 040731 of osh!

This is an enhanced, backward-compatible reimplementation of the
Sixth Edition Unix shell.  The original implementation was written
by Ken Thompson of Bell Labs.  This release of osh was originally
derived from osh-020214 by Gunnar Ritter.  See the manual pages for
additional details.

The NOTES file gives additional information about this implementation
of osh, including some historical and compatibility notes.

--------
INSTALL:
The following steps will normally suffice to build/install osh and
its supporting utilities:

1) Adjust the CONFIGURATION section in the Makefile to match
   your desires and/or the requirements of your system.

2) Type `make' to compile osh, if, and goto.

3) Optionally, type `make check' to run a minimal test suite.
   *) This should be done as a regular user, not the superuser.

4) Type `make install' to install the binaries and manual pages.

--------
Osh is currently developed and maintained on NetBSD and OpenBSD.
The latest release is always tested and known to work correctly on
these systems and also on FreeBSD.  I have received reports that
previous releases build and work correctly on various distributions
of GNU/Linux as well.

To the best of my knowledge this software should build on most any
POSIX-compliant Unix system, but I have not verified this as I do
not have access to other operating systems.  I do welcome reports
of success or failure to build it on other systems.

If you find a bug, please send a bug report to me at the following
email address.  Before reporting a bug, please try to reproduce it
with the latest version of the code.  With bug reports, please try
to ensure that enough information to reproduce the problem is
enclosed, and if a known fix for it exists, include that as well.

If you have any questions about this software, I encourage you to
contact me via email.  Enjoy!
