[osh-050131]:
*.1:
	* Made some revisions and added some new content.

osh and sh6:
	* Did a little code cleanup for the sake of clarity and simplicity.
	  Basically, this just removes some redundant operations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[osh-041231]:
LICENSE:
	* Removed clauses 3 and 4 from the license under which I release
	  this software.  This only affects my license.  Do not worry;
	  this software is still free!  Read LICENSE for further info.
	  Each file on which I explicitly claim copyright also contains
	  a copy of this license.

tests:
	* Added 2 more tests to be run by `make check' and `make check-sh6'.

	* Did a little reorganization.

osh and sh6:
	* Fixed a typo in the execute() function that can cause a memory fault
	  in sh6, and in osh when running in compatible mode.  This error was
	  only possible when using the `chdir' special command preceded by a
	  redirection such as `> file' (e.g., `> /dev/null chdir foo').

	* Made several changes to how the shell reads input into the
	  command-line buffer.  Generally, this is not a user-visible
	  change but is noteworthy nonetheless.

	* Made a few improvements to the parser.
	  It now catches a few errors that could have previously caused some
	  confusion.  Before: `echo \<<', `echo \>>', `echo foo>bar', etc...
	  None of these would have been considered a syntax error.  Now, all
	  of them are.  The unquoted `<' and `>' characters in the above
	  commands are not considered to be redirection arguments.

	  In this implementation of the shell, a redirection argument must be
	  separated from other command-line arguments by one or more blanks.
	  This is unlike other shells.  However, since this is the documented
	  behaviour of the Thompson shell, this implementation of the shell
	  adheres to the documented behaviour for the sake of simplicity.

	* Fixed the incorrect globbing behaviour described in the TODO file.
	  Now, the shell correctly handles quoted glob characters in an
	  argument when the same argument also contains *unquoted* glob
	  characters.  Note that the correct behaviour of globbing in
	  the shell relies on a POSIX-compliant glob(3) being available
	  on the system where the shell is built and/or used.

osh only:
	* Fixed a small problem with the `source' special command.
	  Doing a `source /path/to/nonexistent_file' in an initialization file
	  should not cause the shell to cease execution of that file.  Now,
	  execution of the initialization file continues as normal.  Of course,
	  user can test for error and have the shell act accordingly in such
	  a case.

	* Renamed the `trap' special command to `sigign' since it is really
	  nothing like the trap command found in other shells.  Thus, I thought
	  calling it `trap' could be misleading to the user.  On the other hand,
	  `sigign' makes sense given what the command does, which is to ignore
	  or unignore signals.

if:
	* Did another rewrite of the if(1) utility.
	  Started with a fresh copy of if.c from Sixth Edition Unix.
	  User-visible changes?  None.

goto:
	* Did another rewrite of the goto(1) utility.
	  Started with a fresh copy of goto.c from Sixth Edition Unix.
	  User-visible changes?  Yes, it is no longer an error for a NUL
	  character to appear in the input.  Also, it now prints an explicit
	  `cannot seek' diagnostic if the input file is not seekable.
