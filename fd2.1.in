.TH FD2 1 "January 9, 2008" "@OSH_VERSION@" "General Commands"
.SH NAME
fd2 \- redirect file descriptor 2
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fd2
[\fB\-f\fR \fIfile\fR] \fIcommand\fR [\fIarg ...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Since the shell provides no way to
redirect the diagnostic output,
.I fd2
provides this functionality instead by
executing the specified
.I command
with the given arguments
and redirecting file descriptor 2 (standard error)
.\" either to file descriptor 1 (standard output),
to file descriptor 1 (standard output) by default,
.\" or to a file.
or optionally to the specified file.
.PP
The following option is available:
.TP
.BI \-f \ file
Causes all diagnostic output from
.I command
to be redirected to \fIfile\fR,
which is created if it does not exist.
If it already exists,
all diagnostic output is appended
to the end of \fIfile\fR.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
If
.I fd2
detects an error,
it prints an appropriate diagnostic
and exits with a non-zero status.
Otherwise,
the exit status is that
of the executed command.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following examples assume that the directory
referred to by `/tmp/$$' already exists,
is writable by the user,
and that the shell being used is either
.IR osh (1)
or
.IR sh6 (1).
The following command line:
.PP
.RS 6
fd2 make foo >/tmp/$$/foo.outerr
.RE
.PP
causes all standard and diagnostic output from
.I make
to be redirected to the file `/tmp/$$/foo.outerr',
which is first created by the shell.
In contrast:
.PP
.RS 6
fd2 \-f /tmp/$$/foo.err make foo >/tmp/$$/foo.out
.RE
.PP
causes all standard output to be redirected
to the file `/tmp/$$/foo.out',
which is created by the shell.
All diagnostic output is redirected
to the file `/tmp/$$/foo.err',
which is created by
.I fd2
if it does not already exist.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B EXECSHELL
If set to a non-empty string,
the value of this variable is taken as the
path name of the shell which is invoked to
execute the specified command when it does not
begin with the proper magic number
or a `#!shell' sequence.
.TP
.B PATH
If set to a non-empty string,
the value of this variable is taken as the
sequence of directories which is used to
search for the specified command.
