.TH GLOB6 1 "@OSH_DATE@" "@OSH_VERSION@" "General Commands"
.SH NAME
glob6 \- global command (file name generation)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B glob6
\fIcommand\fR [\fIarg ...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Glob6
is a port of the global command from Sixth Edition UNIX.
It is passed an argument list by
.IR sh6 (1)
which contains one or more unquoted
.I "pattern characters"
(`*', `?', `[')
and performs the actions described below
on behalf of the shell.
.PP
.I Glob6
attempts to generate file-name arguments which match
the given pattern arguments.
The name of the specified
.I command
may also be given as a pattern.
The meaning of each pattern character is as follows:
.IP o 4
The `*' character in a pattern matches any string of
characters in a file name (including the null string).
.IP o
The `?' character in a pattern matches any single character
in a file name.
.IP o
The `[...]' brackets in a pattern specifies a class of characters
which matches any single file-name character in the class.
Within the brackets,
each character is taken to be a member of the class.
A pair of characters separated by an unquoted `\-' specifies
the class as a range which matches each character lexically
between the first and second member of the pair, inclusive.
A `\-' matches itself when quoted or when first or last
in the class.
.PP
Any other character in a pattern matches itself in a file name.
.PP
Notice that the `.' character at the beginning of a file name,
or immediately following a `/',
is always special in that it must be matched explicitly.
The same is true of the `/' character itself.
.PP
If the pattern contains no `/' characters,
the current directory is always used.
Otherwise,
the specified directory is the one obtained by taking the pattern
up to the last `/' before the first unquoted `*', `?', or `['.
The matching process matches the remainder of the pattern
after this `/' against the files in the specified directory.
.PP
If the argument contains no unquoted pattern characters,
.I glob6
uses it as is.
Otherwise,
.I glob6
searches for file names in the current (or specified) directory
which match the pattern.
It then sorts them in ascending ASCII order,
and the new sequence of arguments replaces the given pattern.
The same process is carried out for each of the given arguments;
the resulting lists are
.I not
merged.
Finally,
.I glob6
attempts to execute the command
with the resulting argument list.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
If
.I glob6
detects an error,
it prints an appropriate diagnostic
and exits with a non-zero status.
Otherwise,
the exit status is that
of the executed command.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Notice that the concept of `user environment'
was not defined in Sixth Edition UNIX.
Thus,
use of the following environment variables
by this port of the global command
is an enhancement:
.TP
.B EXECSHELL
If set to a non-empty string,
the value of this variable is taken as the
path name of the shell which is invoked to
execute the specified command when it does not
begin with the proper magic number
or a `#!shell' sequence.
.TP
.B PATH
If set to a non-empty string,
the value of this variable is taken as the
sequence of directories which is used to
search for the specified command.
Notice that the
global command from Sixth Edition UNIX
always used the equivalent of `.:/bin:/usr/bin',
not PATH.
