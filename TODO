The overall design of this implementation requires various workarounds
because of the way that pipes are created.  The workarounds should
not be necessary, but they are.  See the CHANGES file for more info
about some of these workarounds.

For example, pipes are created in pxpipe().  This is done in the
parent process before fork.  I believe they should really be created
in the child process.  This is basically how Ken Thompson's
implementation of the shell does it.

Here is a note I once made to myself in pxpipe():
/*
 * XXX: It should be noted that this is quite simply the wrong place
 *	to create pipes.  Doing it here requires various workarounds
 *	that would not otherwise be required if pipes were created
 *	in forkexec() instead.  I may look into fixing this issue,
 *	but since it works well enough as it is I doubt I will
 *	actually do anything about it in the near future.
