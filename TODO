Firstly, I do not intend to add any other enhancements to osh(1).
It has enough features and is perfectly usable as is.

The incorrect behaviour described below was fixed in osh-041231.
As such, it is no longer on the TODO list but is left here as a
point of reference.

---- 1 ----
The one remaining thing that still needs to be done to the shell
(both osh and sh6) is to better deal with quoting as it relates to
globbing.  This should not be difficult to fix, but it simply takes
time that I do not presently have.  It is also not a critical problem
which interferes with effectively using the shell on a daily basis.

Here is an example of the incorrect behaviour of osh(1) vs. the
correct behaviour of csh(1) and sh(1).

% osh -c "echo R???M?; echo R'???'M?"

% csh -c "set nonomatch; echo R???M?; echo R'???'M?"

R???M?

% sh -c "echo R???M?; echo R'???'M?"
README
R???M?
