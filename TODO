-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The incorrect behaviour described below was fixed in osh-041231.
As such, it is no longer on the TODO list, but the description is
left here for historical reference.

	The one remaining thing that still needs to be done to the
	shell (both osh and sh6) is to better deal with quoting as
	it relates to globbing.

	Here is an example of the incorrect behaviour of osh(1) vs.
	the correct behaviour of csh(1) and sh(1):

		% osh -c "echo R???M?; echo R'???'M?"
		README
		README

		% csh -c "set nonomatch; echo R???M?; echo R'???'M?"
		README
		R???M?

		% sh -c "echo R???M?; echo R'???'M?"
		README
		R???M?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At this point in time, there is nothing more that really *must* be
done.  As such, the developer primarily intends to maintain it as
is for the foreseeable future.
